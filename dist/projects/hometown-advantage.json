    "description": "In our modern era every artist needs a web presence and Chicago-based artist HTA (Hometown Advantage) is no different. Originally using Instagram as a platform for his content and creations, the lack of deep customization and curation quickly became undesirable. <br><br> To free HTA from these restrictions I created a ReactJS based, SPA-style content stream that not only provides a completely custom visual experience but also employs cutting-edge web technologies under the hood. <br><br> In a way, this is a perfect representation of why I love front-end development. The ability to create a uniquely branded, interactive experience like HTA's website is both rewarding and invigorating.",
